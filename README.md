# Low-Level Design (LLD)

A hands-on repository for **Low-Level Design** fundamentals: UML class diagrams, SOLID principles, design patterns, and classic LLD problems. Each topic includes **Java** and **Python** implementations where applicable, with READMEs and examples you can run locally.

---

## What this repo covers

- **UML & class diagrams** — How to model structure and relationships before coding.
- **SOLID principles** — Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.
- **Design patterns** — Creational, structural, and behavioral patterns with code (with/without pattern comparisons where relevant).
- **Problems** — End-to-end designs (e.g. Parking Lot) that tie together patterns and principles.

## UML Diagrams

Intro to UML and class diagrams (elements, relationships, visibility, multiplicity).

| Topic           | Link |
|-----------------|------|
| Class Diagram   | [uml-diagrams/class-diagram](uml-diagrams/class-diagram) |

## SOLID Principles

Java and Python examples (with and without violations) under `SOLID-Principles/java/` and `SOLID-Principles/python/`.

| Java | Python |

## Design Patterns

Java and Python code live under `design-patterns/java/<pattern>/` and `design-patterns/python/<pattern>/`. Each pattern folder has a README and runnable examples.

| Observer             | [design-patterns/java/Observer-DesignPattern](design-patterns/java/Observer-DesignPattern) | [design-patterns/python/Observer-DesignPattern](design-patterns/python/Observer-DesignPattern) |
| Singleton            | [design-patterns/java/Singleton-DesignPattern](design-patterns/java/Singleton-DesignPattern) | [design-patterns/python/Singleton-DesignPattern](design-patterns/python/Singleton-DesignPattern) |
| State                | [design-patterns/java/State-DesignPattern](design-patterns/java/State-DesignPattern) | [design-patterns/python/State-DesignPattern](design-patterns/python/State-DesignPattern) |
| Strategy             | [design-patterns/java/Strategy-DesignPattern](design-patterns/java/Strategy-DesignPattern) | [design-patterns/python/Strategy-DesignPattern](design-patterns/python/Strategy-DesignPattern) |

---

## Problems

Java and Python implementations live under `problems/java/<problem>/` and `problems/python/<problem>/`.

| Problem          | Java | Python |
|------------------|------|--------|
| Parking Lot System | [problems/java/ParkingLotSystem](problems/java/ParkingLotSystem) | [problems/python/ParkingLotSystem](problems/python/ParkingLotSystem) |

---

## Running the code

- **Java:** Open the project in an IDE or use `javac`/`java` from the relevant `java/` (or `java/src/...`) directory.
- **Python:** From the pattern or problem folder (e.g. `design-patterns/python/Adapter-DesignPattern`), set `PYTHONPATH=.` so the `src` package is found, then run the module. Example:
  ```bash
  cd design-patterns/python/Adapter-DesignPattern && PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m src.demo
  ```
  For problems (e.g. Parking Lot), run from the problem folder with `PYTHONPATH=src`:
  ```bash
  cd problems/python/ParkingLotSystem && PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/parking_lot_demo.py
  ```
